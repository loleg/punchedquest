# PunchedQuest!

This is the frontend of our prototype game.

Also check out the [backend](https://github.com/loleg/punchedquest-server).

To install, make sure to

`git submodule init && git submodule update`

Then do this:

```
ln -s RPG-JS/samples/Data
ln -s RPG-JS/samples/Graphics
```

..until we have some gfx of our own!
